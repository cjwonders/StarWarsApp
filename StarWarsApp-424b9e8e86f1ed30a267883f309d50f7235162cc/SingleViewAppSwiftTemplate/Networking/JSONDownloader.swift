// JSONDownloader is used to download JSON Data in a URL Session.
// if http response code is 200.. that is success and I can further serialize the data
// Serialization implies type casting... converting the data type for use in our code. Make sure the types match as per the logic defined in the documentation.

class JSONDownloader {
    let session: URLSession // URLSession instance: An object that coordinates a group of related network data transfer tasks.
    // Oh boy the first one...
    
    //The URLSession class and related classes provide an API for downloading data from and uploading data to endpoints indicated by URLs.

    /*
     
     Loading is performed asynchronously, so your app can remain responsive and handle incoming data or errors as they arrive.
     
     You use a URLSession instance to create one or more URLSessionTask instances, which can fetch and return data to your app, download files, or upload data and files to remote locations. To configure a session, you use a URLSessionConfiguration object, which controls behavior like how to use caches and cookies, or whether to allow connections on a cellular network.
     
     Also, You can use one session repeatedly to create tasks. For example, a web browser might have separate sessions for regular and private browsing use, where the private session doesn’t cache its data.
